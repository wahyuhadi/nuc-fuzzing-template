  description: |
      OS Command Injection is a security vulnerability that occurs when an application improperly passes user-supplied input into system commands. 
      This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or complete server control.

    fixing: 
      -  1. Avoid Direct System Command Execution, Instead of using system commands, use built-in language functions or libraries that provide safer alternatives.
      -  2. Input Validation and Whitelisting, Restrict user input to only expected values, ensuring it does not contain harmful characters.
      -  3. Use Parameterized System Calls, Use functions that do not rely on shell interpretation, like subprocess.run() with an argument list.
      -  4. Implement the Principle of Least Privilege, Ensure that the application runs with the minimal necessary privileges, limiting the damage if an attack occurs.
